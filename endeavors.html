          <h3>Research</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I am doing research through the chemical engineering department with my former fluid mechanics professor. He studies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_threshold#Thresholds_on_slabs"> percolation </a> and lattices (ie systems) in which it occurs. Generally, "studying" means modeling these systems using the C language and running simulations across sets of possible initial conditions.  During the previous semester I had to use a solver to solve ODE systems for reactor design (a class I generally hated). However, I chose to use Python as my solver because I know that learning Python (and Jupyter) is valuable. I enjoyed screwing around with Python way more than I liked doing my actual homework and so I learned quite a bit. So now that I'm doing resarch, I am using what I learned in Python to fetch and plot/visualize data generated with the C modeling programs. </li>
            <li> This summer program will run basically until the end of the summer. I am enjoying learning stuff right now like how actually memory space is used and ssh and just unix in general. In the broad scope, this research is ideally going to help me find the creative/analytic & pragmatic/hardnosed intersection in ChE. We'll see how that works out.</li>

          <h3>Guitar</h3>
          <ul>
              <li> 9/4/18 -- I have made quite a lot of progress in the past couple months. I have learned how to play a couple dozen songs decently well on electric and acoustic and have started learning how to improvise using scales over backing tracks. At this point, I've learned the major and minor pentatonic scale across the fretboard and starting to learn to accentuate using modes.</li>
              <li> 3/11 -- I have made additional progress. I have learned more songs and have been practicing a lot of improvisation. I particularily like playing over Allman Brothers and Grateful Dead style tracks and am actually getting into a bit of 70s country because of this. </li>
              <li> 5/24 -- I have been doing a lot of improvisation over minor 251 progressions over the past couple days as tool to learn the harmonic minor scale and how to use it. 251 progressions are jazzy usually so I might be headed for that rabbit hole, sorry everyone who hears me haha.</li>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p> I've decided that I need a little more rigor in my life and so I am going to give some articulation to my endeavors by writing them down and then comparing my progress to them.</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Work out 3 times a week.</li>
              <li> Get through an introductory linear algebra text this summer (do some reading and problems in the mornings before work)</li>
              <li> Write my own C program from scratch that models a complex percolation system (weighted bonds, directed).</li>
              <li> Convert myself to a hybrid picker. </li>

          <h3>"The Talisman" by Stephen King and Peter Straub</h3>
          <h5><i>The Talisman</i> was the first King-involved book I've read in a while (really, the first full novel I've read recently). It's riveting, althoughly slightly of the same kin as The Series of Unfortunate Event books -- where gaudy misfortune presents itself reliably to the main characters at almost every flip of scenery. Despite this minorly exhausting aspect, which is my only true complaint, I did greatly enjoy the characters. Jack, the extraordinarily witty and mature for his age, and Speedy, old and wizened -- you can literally hear when he says "Yeah-bob".  I really got immersed in the last couple days of reading because the climax spanned about 60-80 pages. While predictable, it was an extremely interesting concept with which King and Straub took no shortcut to explain, though for the better of the story (imo). As always with King, I'm astounded at his ability to make even the most stauch realist fear something at night. Barren and grimy Oatley, the human flytrap, will make me think twice before I stop along the freeway to fill up on gas; Sunlight Gardener and his "home" for the boys who stray from righteousness stokes my preconcieved unease with cult-like fanantics, Sloat's cold-hearted ambition and its resulting terrors incite worries of crazy-ass people in industries of my future employment, and the chicken farmer who gave Jack a lift just weirds me out (also reminds me that social interaction is pretty nice sometimes). King makes you doubt your ability to see evil in everyday life with how he constructs such layered and malevolent characters in such a relatable context. A great read.</h5>

          <h3>"1984" by George Orwell</h3>
          <h5><i>1984</i> was a book that I started to read a few years ago, back when the main attraction of reading a book was to glean its exciting features. I didn't have any sort of political philosophy when I was 13, nor do I really have one at this time, but I now have the capacity to at least appreciate someone's political motives and how they manifest themselves in literature. The reason I threw the word politics out there right away is obvious if you've ever read the book. Orwell's piece de resistance is a critique of English socialism and Russian communism. At 19 years of age and nearly 80 years removed from the climate in which Orwell wrote 1984, this basic level is the extent of my true understanding of its allusion. However, there are many statements made by Orwell which require little historical background of 20th century political ideologies. For example, the most striking parts of the story for me occur when the eventual antagonist pulls the classic "I'm the villian and you're fucked so I'm going to tell you my evil plan" on the protagonist. This is where many of Orwells fierce resentments for the current state of politics rear their collective head as what appears to be a general misanthropy. To sort of switch gears though and deconstruct the tangibles of the book rather than its sociopolitical significance, I sometimes felt confused by the actions of Winston. Sometimes statements were made that suggested that he was eternally conditioned by the party to act in a certain way, but then you would find him defying these conditionings as the "stain" in the Party, but it never really seemed to be explained why he was a special case. I'm not sure, those are my thoughts. It's extremely thought provoking, I RECOMMEND! </h5>
