          <p>Thoughts as I sit on a concrete bench and wait for Orgo Discussion to start</p>


<p>It's really nice out.</p>


<p>I'm glad that I have the presence of mind to not stuff my ears with music which has historically spurred stuffy trains of thought, hindering my ability to grow in thought and enjoy my life.</p>

<p>There are a lot of beautiful people who go to school here.</p>


<p>The people responsible for managing this school at the highest level are geniuses with a great sense of what is valuable in humanity. If you have the management represent the univesity's persona, it is extremely self-aware
in that it recognizes its own size and weight and adjusts accordingly, still accomplishing a rather intensive accomodation of mostly everyone's first world needs.</p>

          <p class="main">Being happy is realizing that the world is senseless and cruel. Being happy is understanding that pure joy is intermittent and sparse. Being happy is consciously being at the mercy of the impersonal universe and being rendered completely powerless at the most basic level.</p>

<p class="main">Happiness is this and, the realization that despite this, the fact that I am here and I am real and I am ready to combat the setbacks that my world will provide me in order to pursue my own idea of happiness. I am a nihilistic coagulation of elemental building blocks, but my pleasures come from having a slow cup of coffee in the morning, intuitively understanding processes which are beyond my comprehension upon encounter, 20 minutes of a budding sunrise, understanding that people think in ways very similar to myself, deflating an inflated east-coast asshole in sporting events, finishing a paper, seeing all of my family happy to see me and be with me, and until I am able to procure practical happiness from the satiation of my outer electron shell, I will remain on my quest to pursue happiness while navigating through the culture of my species with respect and pragmatism.</p>

          <p>So I was writing a story earlier which was supposedly an allegorical criticism of intelligentsian, insular apathy (most likely inspired by my recent dabbling in Reddit), and was appalled to have my laptop die with 10% battery remaining. It's basic premise was to follow an amnesia-stricken man stranded in a desert among animals, where, since humans are the most intellectually capable product of evolution thus far, he develops a god complex. At the end of the story he is gunned down by a helicopter, exposing the fact that the man's sense of superiority was but a product of his limited scope of existence. By the way, I didn't really consider a backstory for the man. Let's just say he was mourning the loss of his favorite sports team and drowned his medial temporal lobe with enough whiskey to forget everything and then the people that gunned him down were border-patrol agents of a future, over-zealously 'native' United States.  <br><br>

Anyways, later that night, in the shower, I stop to think of what my two existential poles are in regard to living my life and what a probable and ideal path down each might be. <br><br> As seen by my callow mind, my choices are:<br><br>

The Indulgently Just Human - who prides in his wonderful successes by traditional metrics of achievement <br><br>

Elon musk type, master engineer holding an apparent influence on certain societal subsets. Struggles making family his passion while remaining scrupulously invested in his career. Mid life crisis hits hard—practiced acceptance of earthly experience as reality and simultaneous importance placed in the grand scheme of life brings crippling self-doubt <br>
<br>

Or <br><br>

The Veritable Homosapien - worships only the energies of deepest origin at any humanitarian cost <br><br>

Societal fugitive, live alone in Eastern Europe among the trees. Tries to repopulate a utopia within, from intellectual scratch <br><br>

Realizing that these are the two options which I have allowed myself to believe, to some extent, that I need to choose from, I believe I understand that I have much learning to do about finding an identity among fellow livers of life (because this kind of drastic dichotomy is just CRAZY)

I must pull a Johnny Cash and find a balance (wondering if he had the keys). I will appreciate the splendors but keep a pragmatic mind.<br><br>

I will bring a sense of wonder and naïvety in practice <br><br>

I will bring obstinance and discipline <br><br>


Due to rumination articulated above, I am glad that my paper was deleted</p>

          <p class="timestamp">11:08PM 8-20-17</p>
          <p>I want to write. I feel that I'm reaching for inspiration when I write this, but really, if I feel the want to write isn't that "inspiration" enough to do it?

            <p class="main">This absurd little thought blurb and seemingly innocuous/simply insignificant doubt is a fitting introduction to how my brain works. I spend a great deal of time, more than I might care to admit, thinking myself in circles until any practical application of that initial train of thought vanishes with my sense of normalcy.</p>

            <p class="main">Take this aforementioned thought for example; I'll take you through how my brain works through this. I read books, I like how the authors express their thoughts and present their views through analogy and fictional circumstance. I,
            being someone who feels the desire to be understood (like many/most I'm sure), imagine that if I wrote some stuff, that desire would be fulfilled in some gratifying capactity. Therefore, before the inspiration flits away, I try to think about something to write about and how I may convey my message through it.
            However, I know neither what it is that I want to convey nor the means by which I want to convey them (poem? novel? indulgent autobiographical ramblings?). In the moment which I realize this, I question myself and whether or not I really do want to write.
            Shortly after this thought, I am reminded of all the successful people I've heard offering their advice regarding following your passions, which normally includes something at least partially summed up by the cliche "you miss 100% of the shots ... " blah blah.
            I'm not discrediting that advice, just pointing out that its cliche. Actually, the fact that soemthing is cliche leads me to consider it with less seriousness or interest, but sometimes really I think I'm just too naive to understand the truthfully
            sound advice hidden in the generalized proverbs. So, I think that I should try and write regardless of how I feel about it while I'm doing it, because at some point in time, I really had the genuine desire to write and I should at least try
            without shaming myself back into whatever I happen to be more comfortable with at the time. Then, when I think about the fact that I initially wanted to start writing at least partially because I wanted to be understood, I am regretful.
            I'm partially inspired by the enjoyment that creating my own work would bring, but moreso motivated by the fact that other people would read and think I'm sophisticated or well-articulated or cool or something. Is this what motivated the poeple
            whose advice I was citing earlier? Or did Steve Jobs just really really like tinkering with computers in his garage? I think the latter is true. Don't get me wrong, there are things I truly love to do for the sake of doing them, but its just really annoying that my brain has to go and try to convince me of my inaptitude/rootlessness before I give something a shot. I try to quell this paralyzing habit of thought and do things anyways.</p>

            <p>This is such an isntance. I have created this portion of my website as a sort of 'will to overcome'. Hope someone enjoys  (haha see what I did there)</p>
