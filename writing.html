            <p>I am actually in Ann Arbor for the first time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I most definitely should have gone off campus last year; it would have saved me a lot of negative emotion (and money). That said, hindsight is what it is and I wouldn't change a thing.</p>
            <p>I feel the nostalgic urge to raise some <em>profound</em> questions about&nbsp;<em>experience</em>, but ultimately I'm content with my current serving of epistemological turmoil (being small).</p>

            <!-- <p> I was talking to my friend the other day about situations where I'm exasperated in a humourous sense (like actually exasperated but trying to find humour regardless). I told her that sometimes I write stuff down that I think is particularily absurd to preserve it for later scathing criticism and snide jokes.</p> -->
            <!-- <p> For example, I was</p> -->
            <p>I'm going to talk a little bit about how happy I am with my weekend because (as my friend reminded me yesterday through an innocuous comment), celebrating and speaking on the good in life is as worthwhile as nearly anything.</p>
            <p>I went out Thursday night after Michigan's basketball game and our IM volleyball game, had a great albeit late night over on Geddes with previously mutual friends.</p>
            <p>Friday, my mom arrived from home and I skipped my Fluids lecture to go out to lunch with her, which was a splendid choice becuase it's typically a complete waste of time and I'm sure Friday was no exception. I stuck around my room and fiddled with the guitar and talked with my friend Chloe all night.</p>
            <p> Yesterday was Saturday and I spent all morning and afternoon playing a triple-header against Central Michigan at Ray Fischer. We won all 3 games -- the second game was insane and ended on a ~400ft 3-run walk-off over left-center field. I pitched the first half of the 3rd game and did okay. It was a great series though, we looked good. </p>
            <p> Saturday night we watched the Elite Eight game and got super hype because we're going to the Final Four!!! and then went to 'Scooter's' house until the wee hours. It was a wild series of events and super fun.</p>
            <p>Today is Sunday, which was also very unproductive academically but fulfilling nonetheless. I played a 3-on-3 basketball tournament and "won" but was jipped out of the prizes by some salty poor sports we played in the champ game who were unaware that in basketball there are time limits and thought that was unfair enough that it warranted threatening the organizers of this (charity) event to make them change the rules. :/ was a fun tourney though. </p>
            <p>Since then, I have done naught but screw with my guitar and eat food, this coming week will likely feature a Nathan that is slightly regretful of this inactivity, but oh well :)</p>

          <p>​ I am something. </p>
          <p> I don't know if it is right to be what I am. It doesn't matter. </p>
          <p> Today was good.</p>
          <p> I like to share my self. </p>
          <p> I could press legitimate and damning questions about my epistemological plights, but it doesn't make me happy or discernibly improve my ability to be a good person the way I know how.</p>
          <p> I think I'm excited to return to school. I hope its not just because I want to see people to whom I over-assign value and thought.</p>
          <p> Music is cruelty and bliss; its life.</p>
          <p> I tend to think carefully about words I use when expressing experience and how their successive use might change their individual meanings.</p>
          <p> I don't particularly like you. This is always true. This is sad. It's not necessary that I do in order for me to appreciate time spent in your presence. I can reconcile this. I don't know who you are. You is me but from a different world. A world where every conglomerate pretense governing reactions to stimuli is different. These worlds were fabricated somehow. No one knows how. This is now where I begrudgingly return above in search of peace and find it half-fledged. *insert potentially corny analogy between phoenix and experiential fledged-ness in weak attempt to legitimize ramblings with familiar human literary context and convince self/reader of aforementioned ability to reconcile* </p>
          <p> I should now end on an uplifting note suggesting that my life will have benefitted from this musing from here on and that I am not still spending time thinking of things like this, but I'd be deceiving myself. I live happily day to day; I already know this. It is okay to removedly reflect without trying to doctor my patterns of thought. It's a bad habit to propagandize yourself. I don't need to prove my happiness to anyone and I believe (as I write this) that this is powerful and important to take to heart.</p>

          <p>Oooh I really like this. I just got a Google Chrome app called "Writer" and there's a setting I turned on so that I hear classic typewriter noises as I type this.</p>

          <p>I wanted to write a bit about the last book I read and also just a bit in general. </p>

          <p><i> Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> (ZAMM) was one of the most interesting books I have read, ever. As one might presume, this was so because of my personal attachment to the subject matter of the book rather than the "quality" of the book. In an attempt to summarize, I will grossly over-generalize the nature of the book and say that it is a philosophical examination of reason (and subsequently, quality).</p>

          <p>Concretely, ZAMM is a man's recollection of a father-son motorcycle trip across the American West. The "underlying form" of the story has more to do with the 'Chautauquas' (the narrator's recounting and musing over his life's meaning as it relates to others). </p>

          <p>More likely than not, this introduction has effectively erased any chance that existed of you ever reading this book, so I will talk freely about some aspects that I found most intriguing without regarding your potential desire to experience this book yourself (IF THIS IS NOT THE CASE, NOTE THIS SPOILER ALERT). </p>

          <p>The narrator is a man in his forties. He has 2 children and a wife. Throughout the first 30-some years of his life, the narrator was a fiercely intellectual academic and proponent of reason as he saw it (an interesting sequence of 5 words there, but fairly representative). He was named Phaedrus by the narrator (after a character in a diaogue of Plato, mistakenly taken by the author (Robert Pirsig) to have meant "wolf" in Greek). He was employed as a rhetoric teacher at a college in Idaho or Montana or something (somewhere up in mountainous country, that's the significance). Phaedrus, in a familiar sort of way, was obsessed with logic, reason, and the 'general societal divergence from their principles' (I'm not quoting him, just summarizing in a manner that doesn't inherently suggest I agree with him totally). This obsession manifested itself as a ferocious demeanor while lecturing and overt distaste for propagators of cookie-cutter knowledge and education in general (i.e. his employing university). </p>

          <p>Phaedrus succeeded academically in his early years, graduating from high school and going to college at the age of 16, only to flunk/drop out of college and move to India. There, he studied Eastern philosophy and religion. Again, in a very similar way, Phaedrus was violently repulsed by that which he did not understand (and therefore was unable to agree with it). This seems to be a pervasive character trait, as Phaedrus saw his world's value only in the context of what he was able to rationalize. Even that which he knew he could not rationalize, he sought to rationalize the unknown-ness of the unknown by means of the known. This 'self-contained loop'-type thought tendency and others akin led Phaedrus along a path which ended at 'epiphany' and self-destruction at the same time. The specifics of this journey are not something I'm going to take the time to convey. </p>

          <p>If you were confused as to why I started referring to the narrator as a different person once I started calling him Phaedrus, you'd be justified. The reason is that Phaedrus is the past-self of the narrator. Phaedrus, on his lifelong journey pursuing the ghost of reason (the meaning of that phrase explained in depth in the book), lost control of his mind and was forced to undergo electro-shock therapy; his personality was stripped from him and replaced by that of the narrator who we seem to know.</p>

          <p>The narrator, who recounts this tale of Phaedrus among abundant anecdotal pondering about the dichotomy between romantic (impressionist, subjective, "feeling") and classic (alpha-numeric, sequential, logical, Phaedrus-type) experience and the divide's root cause, comes across as having bridged the abyss between sanity and happiness. He acts as if he has learned from his dark past and is now using his knowledge gained through suffering to live a happy life among 'regular folk in a simple manner'. He coos lots of over-generalizations about life as humans which are very convincing until you realize that you and he have met and probably will meet such a small percentage of the human population in your/his lifetime that trying to profess abstract conceptions governing their lives in general is about the most idiotic and short-sighted a competent and able person could do with their time -- not to mention that "meeting" someone is inexpressibly non-representative of understanding their thoughts, motivations, and being. The reason why this was so irritating was the sense of pseudo self-awareness he tried to give off by saying "oh, I'm not very knowledgeable about so and so" or "this is just as I see it". The aforementioned Chautauquas are intermission-ed by brief dialogues between the narrator and son Chris, his family friends who were along for part of the trip (the Sutherland's),  a meal along the road between the four of them, or some description of the scenery in some thinly veiled analogy to the most recently mentioned philosophic point of conversation. </p>

          <p>The ending of the book was quite confusing at first. Basically, they reach the western coast and Chris (his son), is sick of the trip (understandably so, its been at least a month long). Also, the narrator has been plagued by vivid dreams of Phaedrus and "fragments" of his memory from before the personality switch, suggesting that the narrator is losing a grip on his identity. Along the Californian coast, things culminate as Chris openly expresses his hate for how long the trip has lasted and for his dad's behavior since his electro-therapy. The narrator is seemingly thrown by this, saying that he is not understanding how his son would appreciate the manic obsession for philosophical righteousness over the calm father who seems to just like computer manuals and taking his son for trips on his motorcycle. Beyond this lack of understanding though, the narrator is afraid because he feels Phaedrus returning. He has known it for a while, but Chris saying these words has brought him to a point where he cannot keep Phaedrus' identity underneath any longer.
          The story comes to its climax as the narration switches to sans serif, signifying Phaedrus' return and Chris and Phaedrus begin their return home.</p>

           <p>The afterword of the book reveals a bit about the author's intentions with the meaning of the book, which completely changed my perspective on it. He says that Phaedrus was the more organic personality of the narrator and that the new and serene, taken-on personality which followed the electro-therapy was only a facade covering a secret that Phaedrus had uncovered in his pursuit of the ghost of reason (basically the unification of the ubiquitous eastern and western philosophies through the exposition of Aristotle's use of social rank and power to manipulate the lasting perception of the rhetoricians of Ancient Greece as "feely" and as lacking objective purpose in their actions/philosophies in an attempt to preserve his own intellectual preeminence and legacy). The narrator is supposedly wrong for trying to live his life cognizant of this secret and not acting upon its implications. Therefore, it is intended to be a triumphant ending in which Phaedrus reclaims his faculties and 'shoos out the weak impostor' rather than a tragic ending in which a recovered victim of a hyperactive mind slips back into a vegetating and self-contained personality. </p>

          <p>A little about why I think this was interesting. </p>

          <p>Firstly, an acknowledgement of the irony involved with me reading the book at all. Leigh suggested that I read this because of a conversation I had with my mom that he was privy of which left her concerned that I was spending too much time thinking. Apparently, Leigh remembers this book as one where "a guy who thought too much realized that thinking too much leads to nothing much but self-destruction" and recommended it, but as I mentioned about the ending, that's really the opposite of what Robert Pirsig was trying to convey. He literally says in the foreword (which wasn't of much significance to me until actually read the book) "For more on the real Phaedrus [talking about himself], who is not a villainous ghost but rather a mild-mannered hyper-intellectual, let me recommend Lila, a sequel that has been properly understood by very few." He then goes on to link a website he claims is a community of people who actually do understand it. Surprisingly, he doesn't ask the reader to go out on a limb of faith and drink cyanide in honor of his superior life outlook's conception.</p>

          <p>Secondly, it's really interesting how suckered I was into this guy's personal philosophy just because it came from the guise of a reasonably level-headed guy who held the mutual belief that most people don't put a lot of thought into the why's and how's of life and that there is something wrong with that.</p>

           <p>I think that a lesson that reading this book has taught me is remain a student, objectively and subjectively. Phaedrus was a grade A student objectively speaking, but his outlook on life lead him to dismiss almost all that didn't check out in his flowchart of reason and logic. Basically, understanding that objectivity is subjective and that subjectivity is not objective and that anything beyond that is all well and good on paper, but is not really worth the time to flesh out.</p>

          <p>So, I guess the ultimate irony is that ZAMM did really teach me what Leigh intended it to.</p>

          <p>Thoughts as I sit on a concrete bench and wait for Orgo Discussion to start</p>


<p>It's really nice out.</p>


<p>I'm glad that I have the presence of mind to not stuff my ears with music which has historically spurred stuffy trains of thought, hindering my ability to grow in thought and enjoy my life.</p>

<p>There are a lot of beautiful people who go to school here.</p>


<p>The people responsible for managing this school at the highest level are geniuses with a great sense of what is valuable in humanity. If you have the management represent the univesity's persona, it is extremely self-aware
in that it recognizes its own size and weight and adjusts accordingly, still accomplishing a rather intensive accomodation of mostly everyone's first world needs.</p>

          <p class="main">Being happy is realizing that the world is senseless and cruel. Being happy is understanding that pure joy is intermittent and sparse. Being happy is consciously being at the mercy of the impersonal universe and being rendered completely powerless at the most basic level.</p>

<p class="main">Happiness is this and, the realization that despite this, the fact that I am here and I am real and I am ready to combat the setbacks that my world will provide me in order to pursue my own idea of happiness. I am a nihilistic coagulation of elemental building blocks, but my pleasures come from having a slow cup of coffee in the morning, intuitively understanding processes which are beyond my comprehension upon encounter, 20 minutes of a budding sunrise, understanding that people think in ways very similar to myself, deflating an inflated east-coast asshole in sporting events, finishing a paper, seeing all of my family happy to see me and be with me, and until I am able to procure practical happiness from the satiation of my outer electron shell, I will remain on my quest to pursue happiness while navigating through the culture of my species with respect and pragmatism.</p>

          <p>So I was writing a story earlier which was supposedly an allegorical criticism of intelligentsian, insular apathy (most likely inspired by my recent dabbling in Reddit), and was appalled to have my laptop die with 10% battery remaining. It's basic premise was to follow an amnesia-stricken man stranded in a desert among animals, where, since humans are the most intellectually capable product of evolution thus far, he develops a god complex. At the end of the story he is gunned down by a helicopter, exposing the fact that the man's sense of superiority was but a product of his limited scope of existence. By the way, I didn't really consider a backstory for the man. Let's just say he was mourning the loss of his favorite sports team and drowned his medial temporal lobe with enough whiskey to forget everything and then the people that gunned him down were border-patrol agents of a future, over-zealously 'native' United States.  <br><br>

Anyways, later that night, in the shower, I stop to think of what my two existential poles are in regard to living my life and what a probable and ideal path down each might be. <br><br> As seen by my callow mind, my choices are:<br><br>

The Indulgently Just Human - who prides in his wonderful successes by traditional metrics of achievement <br><br>

Elon musk type, master engineer holding an apparent influence on certain societal subsets. Struggles making family his passion while remaining scrupulously invested in his career. Mid life crisis hits hard—practiced acceptance of earthly experience as reality and simultaneous importance placed in the grand scheme of life brings crippling self-doubt <br>
<br>

Or <br><br>

The Veritable Homosapien - worships only the energies of deepest origin at any humanitarian cost <br><br>

Societal fugitive, live alone in Eastern Europe among the trees. Tries to repopulate a utopia within, from intellectual scratch <br><br>

Realizing that these are the two options which I have allowed myself to believe, to some extent, that I need to choose from, I believe I understand that I have much learning to do about finding an identity among fellow livers of life (because this kind of drastic dichotomy is just CRAZY)

I must pull a Johnny Cash and find a balance (wondering if he had the keys). I will appreciate the splendors but keep a pragmatic mind.<br><br>

I will bring a sense of wonder and naïvety in practice <br><br>

I will bring obstinance and discipline <br><br>


Due to rumination articulated above, I am glad that my paper was deleted</p>

          <p>I want to write. I feel that I'm reaching for inspiration when I write this, but really, if I feel the want to write isn't that "inspiration" enough to do it?

            <p class="main">This absurd little thought blurb and seemingly innocuous/simply insignificant doubt is a fitting introduction to how my brain works. I spend a great deal of time, more than I might care to admit, thinking myself in circles until any practical application of that initial train of thought vanishes with my sense of normalcy.</p>

            <p class="main">Take this aforementioned thought for example; I'll take you through how my brain works through this. I read books, I like how the authors express their thoughts and present their views through analogy and fictional circumstance. I,
            being someone who feels the desire to be understood (like many/most I'm sure), imagine that if I wrote some stuff, that desire would be fulfilled in some gratifying capactity. Therefore, before the inspiration flits away, I try to think about something to write about and how I may convey my message through it.
            However, I know neither what it is that I want to convey nor the means by which I want to convey them (poem? novel? indulgent autobiographical ramblings?). In the moment which I realize this, I question myself and whether or not I really do want to write.
            Shortly after this thought, I am reminded of all the successful people I've heard offering their advice regarding following your passions, which normally includes something at least partially summed up by the cliche "you miss 100% of the shots ... " blah blah.
            I'm not discrediting that advice, just pointing out that its cliche. Actually, the fact that soemthing is cliche leads me to consider it with less seriousness or interest, but sometimes really I think I'm just too naive to understand the truthfully
            sound advice hidden in the generalized proverbs. So, I think that I should try and write regardless of how I feel about it while I'm doing it, because at some point in time, I really had the genuine desire to write and I should at least try
            without shaming myself back into whatever I happen to be more comfortable with at the time. Then, when I think about the fact that I initially wanted to start writing at least partially because I wanted to be understood, I am regretful.
            I'm partially inspired by the enjoyment that creating my own work would bring, but moreso motivated by the fact that other people would read and think I'm sophisticated or well-articulated or cool or something. Is this what motivated the poeple
            whose advice I was citing earlier? Or did Steve Jobs just really really like tinkering with computers in his garage? I think the latter is true. Don't get me wrong, there are things I truly love to do for the sake of doing them, but its just really annoying that my brain has to go and try to convince me of my inaptitude/rootlessness before I give something a shot. I try to quell this paralyzing habit of thought and do things anyways.</p>

            <p>This is such an isntance. I have created this portion of my website as a sort of 'will to overcome'. Hope someone enjoys  (haha see what I did there)</p>
